# GreenQuest
GreenQuest is a web platform that makes learning about the environment fun for students. It includes interactive lessons, eco-challenges, leaderboards, and a community feed. Teachers can track student progress, NGOs can start campaigns, and students can earn eco-points, badges, and recognition for their real-world impact.
